## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
composer require --dev backpack/generators 
```

## Usage

Open the console and enter one of the commands:


- **Generate Backpack\CRUD interfaces for all Eloquent models that don't already have one:**

```bash
php artisan backpack:build
```

- **Generate all files for one new Backpack\CRUD interface:**

``` bash
php artisan backpack:crud {Entity_name}

# Use singular, either PascalCase, snake_case or kebab-case.
# This will create a Model if there isn't one, or add
# our CrudTrait to the model if it already exists.
```

- **Generate all files for a custom admin panel page:**

``` bash
php artisan backpack:page {PageName}

# You can use either PascalCase, snake_case or kebab-case.
# This will generate you a Controller, a view and a route.
```

- Generate a new Backpack\CRUD file:
``` bash
php artisan backpack:crud-controller {Entity_name}
php artisan backpack:crud-model {Entity_name}
php artisan backpack:crud-request {Entity_name}
```

- Generate a model (available options: --softdelete)

``` bash
php artisan backpack:model {Entity_name}
```

- Generate a request

``` bash
php artisan backpack:request {Entity_name}
```

- Generate a view (available options: --plain)

``` bash
php artisan backpack:view {Entity_name}
``` 

- Generate a config file

``` bash
php artisan backpack:config {Entity_name}
```

## Hire us

We've spend more than 50.000 hours creating, polishing and maintaining administration panels on Laravel. We've developed e-Commerce, e-Learning, ERPs, social networks, payment gateways and much more. We've worked on admin panels _so much_, that we've created one of the most popular software in its niche - just from making public what was repetitive in our projects.

If you are looking for a developer/team to help you build an admin panel on Laravel, look no further. You'll have a difficult time finding someone with more experience & enthusiasm for this. This is _what we do_. [Contact us](https://backpackforlaravel.com/need-freelancer-or-development-team). Let's see if we can work together.
