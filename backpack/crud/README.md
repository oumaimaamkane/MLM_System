Among the FREE features of each admin interface:
- [List](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/5.x/crud-operation-list-entries) operation
   - 24 column types
   - 1-1, 1-n and n-n relationships
   - table view with search, pagination
   - click column header to sort by it
   - custom buttons
   - details row
   - easily create new column types
   - easily override an existing column type
- [Create](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/5.x/crud-operation-create) / [Update](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/5.x/crud-operation-update) operations
   - 29 field types
   - back-end validation using Laravel Form Requests
   - translatable models (multi-language)
   - have multiple fields per line
   - split fields into tabs
- [Delete](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/5.x/crud-operation-delete) operation
- [Reorder](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/5.x/crud-operation-reorder) operation
- [Revise](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/5.x/crud-operation-revisions) operation (aka. audit log)

But professionals don't love Backpack just because it's feature-packed. They also love it because it's **ridiculously easy to override a functionality**. Generally, you just need to create a function (or blade file) with the right name. Yes, it can be _that_ easy.

> Need more complex features? Purchase [Backpack PRO](https://backpackforlaravel.com/pricing), our closed-source paid add-on. It will add **5 more operations, 10 filters, 28 more fields, 6 more columns and 1 more widget**. For more info, see our [FREE vs PRO comparison table](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/5.x/features-free-vs-paid). We believe it's everything you need to build admin panels of _any_ complexity.

## Change Log

## Security

> It's _heavily_ recommended that you **[subscribe to the Backpack Newsletter](http://backpackforlaravel.com/newsletter)** so you can find out about any security updates, breaking changes or major features. We send an email about 1-2 emails per year. Sometimes less.

If you discover any security related issues, please email hello@backpackforlaravel.com instead of using the issue tracker. Alternatively, please disclose the issue on [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/) to also get a small bounty ($25-40).

## License

Starting with v5, Backpack has become open-core. Its features have been separated into two packages:
- **Backpack CRUD is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md)** (open-source free software); it is perfect if you're building a simple admin panel - it's packed with features! it's also perfect if you're building an open-source project, the permissive license allows you to do whatever you want;
- **Backpack PRO is licensed under our [EULA](https://backpackforlaravel.com/eula)**; it is a closed-source, paid add-on; [PRO](https://backpackforlaravel.com/products/pro) will be useful when your admin panel needs grow, because it adds adds A LOT of features for complex use cases (see our [FREE vs PRO comparison](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/5.x/features-free-vs-paid));

[Our documentation](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs) covers both CRUD and PRO, with all the PRO features clearly labeled <span class="badge badge-pill badge-info">PRO</span>.

<a name="versioning"></a>
## Versioning

Starting with Backpack v5, all our packages follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Here's what `major.minor.patch` (eg. `5.0.1`) means for us:
- `major` - breaking changes, major new features, complete rewrites; released **once a year**, in February; it adds features that were previously impossible and upgrades our dependencies; upgrading is done by following our clear and detailed upgrade guides;
- `minor` - new features, released in backwards-compatible ways; **every few months**; update takes seconds;
- `patch` - bug fixes & small non-breaking changes; historically **every week**; update takes seconds;

When we release a new Backpack\CRUD version, all paid addons receive support for it the same day. 

When you buy a premium Backpack addon, you get access to not only _updates_, but also _upgrades_ (for 12mo), that means that... **any time you buy a Backpack addon, it is very likely that you're not only buying the _current_ version** (`v5` at the moment), **but also the upgrade to the _next version_** (`v6` for example).
